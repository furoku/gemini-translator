## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security reports.

Preferred: use GitHub Security Advisories for this repository to submit a private report.
If that is not possible, open a minimal issue and request a private contact method.

Include:

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce or a proof of concept
- Affected versions

We will acknowledge reports as soon as possible and provide a timeline for a fix when confirmed.
